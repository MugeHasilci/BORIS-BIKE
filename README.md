# Boris Bike Challenge
An exercise to model how Boris Bikes work

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to develop my skills as a developer, in particular:

- Writing code that is easy to change
- Testing driving my code
- Building with objects
- Understand how ruby works

## I am learning how to make software

- I am learning how to build with objects
  - I can explain how classes are used for encapsulation
  - I can explain the difference between state and behaviour
  - I can use dependency injection

- I am learning how to do Test Driven Development
  - I understand what the purpose of a unit test is
  - I can write a unit test in Rspec
  - I can use doubles to isolate unit tests

## I am learning about software
- I am learning how my language works
  - I understand the difference between a variable and a constant
  - I can define a class
  - I can define methods and instance variables within a class

- I am learning what makes software well-engineered

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like to get a bike from a docking station.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).
